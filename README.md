## Automatic Raid Roles
> An addon to automatically set your roles whenever you join a raid.
> Simple.
> Inspired on Aguru's example. Made easy for the public to identify.


### How to configure
- Simply set your role in a raid. The role will be remembered whenever you join another raid again.
- If you want to change the saved settings prior to entering a raid, check settings at `Addons -> Automatic Raid Roles`, where you can manually change it too.
